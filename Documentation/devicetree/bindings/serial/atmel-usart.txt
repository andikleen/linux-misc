* Atmel Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-usart"
  The compatible <chip> indicated will be the first SoC to support an
  additional mode or an USART new feature.
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt

Optional properties:
- atmel,use-dma-rx: use of PDC or DMA for receiving data
- atmel,use-dma-tx: use of PDC or DMA for transmitting data
- add dma bindings for dma transfer:
	- dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node,
		memory peripheral interface and USART DMA channel ID, FIFO configuration.
		Refer to dma.txt and atmel-dma.txt for details.
	- dma-names: "rx" for RX channel, "tx" for TX channel.

Example:
- use PDC:
	usart0: serial@fff8c000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-usart";
		reg = <0xfff8c000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <7>;
		atmel,use-dma-rx;
		atmel,use-dma-tx;
	};

- use DMA:
	usart0: serial@f001c000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-usart";
		reg = <0xf001c000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <12 4 5>;
		atmel,use-dma-rx;
		atmel,use-dma-tx;
		dmas = <&dma0 2 0x3>,
		       <&dma0 2 0x204>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
