Link time optimization (LTO) for the Linux kernel

This is an experimential feature.

Link Time Optimization allows the compiler to optimize the complete program
instead of just each file.  Link Time Optimization is a new feature in gcc 4.6,
but only really works with gcc 4.7 (but still various issues)

The compiler can inline between files and do some other global optimizations.
It will also drop unused functions which can make the kernel image smaller
in some circumstances.  Build time and memory consumption of the build will increase.

Normal "reasonable" builds work with less than 4GB of RAM, but very large
configurations like allyesconfig need slightly more.

Issues:
- 32bit builds currently crash gcc 4.7 (WIP)
- allnoconfig also crashes
- 64bit works, but only limited configs tested in a limited way.
- Various workarounds in kernel for toolchain problems. Some 
of them are obsolete.
- A few kernel features are currently incompatible, in particular
function tracing, because they require special compiler flags for
specific files, which is not supported in LTO right now.
- Some of the kernel changes for correct section attributes
break obscure ports with broken tool chains (pa-risc) (WIP)

Configuration:
- Enable CONFIG_LTO_MENU and then disable CONFIG_LTO_DISABLE.
This is mainly to not have allyesconfig default to LTO.
- FUNCTION_TRACER, STACK_TRACER, FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER have to disabled
because they are currently incompatible with LTO.

Requirements:
- Enough memory: 4GB for a standard build, ~6GB for allyesconfig
If you are tight on memory and use tmpfs as /tmp define TMPDIR and 
point it to a directory on disk. And dial down the -jN number
during the kernel build.

- HJ Lu's Linux binutils from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/
Sorry standard binutils releases don't work
The kernel build has to use this linker, so if it is installed 
in a non standard location use LD=... on the make line.

- gcc 4.7 built with plugin ld (--with-plugin-ld) also pointing to the 
linker from HJ's binutils and LTO 

Example build procedure for the tool chain and kernel. This does not 
overwrite the standard compiler toolchain on the system. If you already
have a suitable gcc 4.7+ compiler and linker the toolchain build can
be skipped.

Get HJ Lu Linux binutils from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/
The standard binutils do not work at this point!
