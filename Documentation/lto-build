Link time optimization (LTO) for the Linux kernel

This is an experimental feature which still has various problems.

Link Time Optimization allows the compiler to optimize the complete program
instead of just each file.  Link Time Optimization was a new feature in gcc 4.6,
but only really works with gcc 4.7. The kernel LTO build also requires
the Linux binutils (the normal FSF releases do not work at the moment)

The compiler can inline functions between files and do some other global
optimizations.  It will also drop unused functions which can make the kernel
image smaller in some circumstances.  The binary gets somewhat larger.
In return the resulting kernels (usually) have better performance.

Build time and memory consumption at build time will increase.
The build time penalty depends on the size of the vmlinux. Reasonable 
sized vmlinux build about twice as long, much larger monolithic kernels 
like allyesconfig ~4x as long. Modular kernels are less affected.

Normal "reasonable" builds work with less than 4GB of RAM, but very large
configurations like allyesconfig may need more memory. The actual
memory needed depends on the available memory (gcc sizes its garbage
collector pools based on that or on the ulimit -m limits)

Issues:
- Various workarounds in kernel needed for toolchain problems.
- A few kernel features are currently incompatible with LTO, in particular
function tracing, because they require special compiler flags for
specific files, which is not supported in LTO right now.
- The build is faster with LTO_SLIM enabled, but this still triggers
problems in some circumstances (currently disabled)
- Jobserver control for -j does not work correctly for the final
LTO phase. The makefiles hardcodes -j<number of online cpus>

Configuration:
- Enable CONFIG_LTO_MENU and then disable CONFIG_LTO_DISABLE.
This is mainly to not have allyesconfig default to LTO.
- FUNCTION_TRACER, STACK_TRACER, FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER have to disabled
because they are currently incompatible with LTO.
- MODVERSIONS have to be disabled because they are not fixed for LTO
yet.

Requirements:
- Enough memory: 4GB for a standard build, more for allyesconfig
If you are tight on memory and use tmpfs as /tmp define TMPDIR and 
point it to a directory on disk.  The peak memory usage
happens single threaded (when lto-wpa merges types), so dialing
back -j options will not help much.

A 32bit compiler is unlikely to work due to the memory requirements.
You can however build a kernel targetted at 32bit on a 64bit host.

Sorry standard binutils releases don't work
The kernel build has to use this linker, so if it is installed 
in a non standard location use LD=... on the make line.

- gcc 4.7 built with plugin ld (--with-plugin-ld) also pointing to the 
linker from the Linux binutils and LTO 

If the gcc is not built with this option it may also work to put the correct
binutils linker first in $PATH when building. I haven't tested
this however.

Example build procedure for the tool chain and kernel. This does not 
overwrite the standard compiler toolchain on the system. If you already
have a suitable gcc 4.7+ compiler and linker the toolchain build can
be skipped (note that a distribution gcc 4.7 is not necessarily
correctly configured for LTO)

The standard binutils do not work at this point!

Unpack binutils

cd binutils-VERSION  (or plain binutils in some versions)
./configure --prefix=/opt/binutils-VERSION --enable-plugins
nice -n20 make -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
sudo make install
sudo ln -sf /opt/binutils-VERSION/bin/ld /usr/local/bin/ld-plugin

Unpack gcc-4.7

mkdir obj-gcc
# please don't skip this cd. the build will not work correctly in the 
# source dir, you have to use the separate object dir
cd obj-gcc
# make sure to install gmp-devel and mpfr-devel
# and the 32bit glibc package if you have a multilib system
# if mpc-devel is not there get it from
# http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/download/mpc-0.8.2.tar.gz
# and install in gcc-4.7*/mpc

--with-plugin-ld=/usr/local/bin/ld-plugin  \

# get lto tree in linux-lto

mkdir obj-lto
cd obj-lto
