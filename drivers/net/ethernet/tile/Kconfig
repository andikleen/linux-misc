	  This is a standard Linux network device driver for the
	  on-chip Tilera Gigabit Ethernet and XAUI interfaces.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tile_net.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_TILEGX
        tristate "Tilera TILE-Gx mPIPE as PTP clock"
        select PTP_1588_CLOCK
        depends on TILE_NET
        depends on TILEGX
        ---help---
          This driver adds support for using the mPIPE as a PTP
          clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
          getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
          using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.
